# Weather Widget

 
This is a simple weather app made using React.

It has been made using accuweather API.

A working demo of this app can be found [here](https://mausam-today.netlify.com/).

**Note** :- Please note that it is using free API so no of requests per day is limited to 25. So if it is not running properly maybe the limit has exceeded. You can try again the next day.
